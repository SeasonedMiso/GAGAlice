#wake up
#she waters herself

#if trust == 0 then she's mopey, so make sure enough chances to get it to be > 1
#talk to her
#decide to go shopping with her

#she pushes you to try on clothes that you think don't suit you (pastel bright colors)
#Sees someone busking/band poster or something, she gets interested in music
#"oh yeah i think i have an old guitar underneath my bed"

#on the way home you come across a butterfly, which ends up dropping dead after stopping on her finger
#she explains about her toxicity, and the danger she poses to people in high doses

#get home, missed call from dad, who saw account activity from where you went shopping
#choice -> call back?
#if call back trust++
#call goes really badly, and dad is abusive
#[do you only show one side of it or skip dialogue or whole dialogue]

#after call you talk to alice who's been messing around on guitar
#deep conversation about parents and past

#<- maybe the order here needs to change ->
#defuse by doing something together, show her music on youtube?  maybe you show her a little bit before, and then something after?
