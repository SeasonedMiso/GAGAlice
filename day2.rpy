#wake up
#she waters herself

#if trust == 0 then she's mopey, so make sure enough chances to get it to be > 1
#talk to her


#you compliment her style and sense of fashion
#she roasts what you're wearing

#she offers to pick out some clothes for you
#decide to go shopping with her

#she pushes you to try on clothes that you think don't suit you (pastel bright colors)


#Sees someone busking/band poster or something, she gets interested in music
#"oh yeah i've heard my neighbour play guitar before... I wonder if... nevermind..."
#her eyes light up and she begs for you to go speak to him
#choice
#you decide to try strike up a convo with him when you return back

#she's beaming and being a lot friendlier to you on the way back
#you listen to her ranting about what she's excited to try

#on the way home you come across a butterfly, which ends up dropping dead after stopping on her finger
#her mood comes to a stand still
#she stops wanting to talk
#choice whether to get her to open up adds a point to trust
#if trust is high enough
#she explains about her toxicity, and the danger she poses to those around her (people) in high doses

#choice whether to get the courage to talk to neighbour

#neighbour comes to his door
#you're taken back by his clothing
#you can see inside his room is fulled with colorful posters, chokers, thighghighs, other stuff like that
#MC blushes slightly when talking to him due to being embarssed by the way he's dressed 
#you introduce yourself as his neighbour, all while feeling like its super awkward because its too late
#he beams and is excited to finally meet you

#"is this not a good time? I can maybe come back later if you're... busy"
#"no, I'm fine, I was just [doing something]"
#he's very unashamed and forthcoming about his interests
#You nervously being trying to ask
#he ends up getting over the toply worried expecting that you are going to tell him about someone being murdered on the floor or something
#his assumption about the situation is that something bad MUST have happened, because he's picking up how stressed you are

#when you clear the confusion and finally say that you heard him playing guitar and were wondering if you could borrow it for the weekend
#his expresion instantly brightens and he's super excited for you to try it
#YOU WANT TO START GUITAR?? WE SHOULD START A BAND! I know a bassist in my computer science class, we should totally jam sometime
#you try to play down his expectations because you're just a beginner, 
#he sees you looking at the band posters, and is excited that you  might be interested
#He asks you what kind of music you're into
#you know he's listened to stuff with screaming in it so you try your best to pretend like you know what you're talking about
#even though you've only every listened to lofi live streams, game osts, and anime intros
#choice of 3 genres to get different reactions from him
#if you say emo: he asks which bands, you answer MCR and stuff, because you had seen people online say that's emo
#he gives you a variation of the 'real emo" copy pasta as a response

#he offers to give you lessons
#you turn him down, but he loans you : 1 guitar, an amp (has headphone-in), a box of different sorts of picks, 3 live bluerays for his fav bands
#he apologizes that his spare guitar's strings are super old, but he needs his main gutiar for practice, and it's set to a weird tuning (and it's an 8 string)
#you waddle over back to your room after exhcanging discord accounts with him
#alice is waiting inside and is super excited, but is trying to keep her composture (failing)
#you set it up for her and she starts messing around (not really knowing what to do)
#You've never been good at gutiar but your parents paid for lessons for you for a semester in highschool, but you never practiced, so they stopped paying
#you show her the very basics of low vs high string, and how to fret. show her an E minor chord
#while she's messing around you get up and see your phone on your desk

#missed call from dad, who saw account activity from where you went shopping
#he won't give you your own card and has a card on his account so he gets a text msg when ever you spend money, and can see where

#choice -> call back?
#if call back trust++

#call goes really badly, and dad is abusive
#"I saw you bought some clothes... from a women's store... I didn't raise you to be like this" etc

#[do you only show one side of it or skip dialogue or whole dialogue]

#after call you talk to alice who's been messing around on guitar
#deep conversation about parents and past

#<- maybe the order here needs to change ->
#defuse by doing something together, show her music on youtube?  maybe you show her a little bit before, and then something after?
