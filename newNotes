Basic plot progression
    Intro
        Alice is bossy and not very nice to mc, because she has self esteem issues 
            ( she tries to have sex with you, you reject her, runs away and then harrasses a person )
        mc breaks her pride and she's left purposeless
            (not because he wants to but out of circumstance)
            (She's left kinda empty and spaced out)
            (You decide to show her the stars, but she kidna doesn't get it)
    Progression

        go to mall, mc shows her stuff
            (Stuff that MC thinks reflects life meaning)
        on the way home she finds the band thing and decides on that
            (Mostly out of just vibes, and because she doesn't have the time to choose)
        (scrap the butteryfly scene i think)
