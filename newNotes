Basic plot progression
    Intro
        Alice is bossy and not very nice to mc, because she has self esteem issues 

            ( she tries to have sex with you, you reject her, runs away and then harrasses a person )
           
            [Worst end: you let her have dom you and give in to her charm, which leads to her becoming dependent on you for validation
                You losing your sense of self, and ending in her telling you to eat her, and ending up dying by overreacting to thinking you've been poisoned, plus having no point in living if you can't serve her
                What's the point in this route? Firstly It should be shocking and more scary than the other parts of the game, but it should also go to show the dangers of seeking external validation, and co-dependency, so focus on that.
            ]

                [bad end: You don't go after her when she runs away]

        mc breaks her pride and she's left purposeless

            (not because he wants to but out of circumstance)
            (She's left kinda empty and spaced out)
            (You decide to show her the stars, but she kidna doesn't get it)
                [bad end: You make her even more depressed]
    Progression
        look for something new to do for a purpose
        go to mall, mc shows her stuff

            (Stuff that MC thinks reflects life meaning)

                [bad end: You take her somewhere weird like a brothel idk]

        on the way home she finds the band thing and decides on that

            (Mostly out of just vibes, and because she doesn't have the time to choose)

        (scrap the butteryfly scene i think)

            [bad end: You discourage her from pursuing the one thing she's found]

        begins practicing

            (She's basically a genius and gets very good very fast)            
    Climax

        you go to get her strings on the way back you get a call from your dad (about clothes etc)

        You come back and she starts to get really anxious and perfectionist about the show

            [Neutral end: you don't take the call and as a result there's no arguement, and she ends up letting her self get overly stressed out and anxious]

        You blow up at her and have an emotional fight with her

            [bad end: You don't make ammends with her]

        At the end you both walk away from it feeling a little bit better

        She does the show and it doesn't go that great

    Conclusion

        She's still glad to have done it, and can die happily

        You walk away with a new perspective and new found hope
        (Good END)
