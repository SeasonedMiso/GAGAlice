#He asks you what kind of music you're into
#you know he's listened to stuff with screaming in it so you try your best to pretend like you know what you're talking about
#even though you've only every listened to lofi live streams, game osts, and anime intros
#choice of 3 genres to get different reactions from him
#if you say emo: he asks which bands, you answer MCR and stuff, because you had seen people online say that's emo
#he gives you a variation of the 'real emo" copy pasta as a response

#he offers to give you lessons
#you turn him down, but he loans you : 1 guitar, an amp (has headphone-in), a box of different sorts of picks, 3 live bluerays for his fav bands
#he apologizes that his spare guitar's strings are super old, but he needs his main gutiar for practice, and it's set to a weird tuning (and it's an 8 string)
label:day2GuitarSetup
#you waddle over back to your room after exhcanging discord accounts with him
    #where do we show this     

#alice is waiting inside and is super excited, but is trying to keep her composture (failing)
#you set it up for her and she starts messing around (not really knowing what to do)
#You've never been good at gutiar but your parents paid for lessons for you for a semester in highschool, but you never practiced, so they stopped paying
#you show her the very basics of low vs high string, and how to fret. show her an E minor chord
#it's a little out of tune, so you try to tune it up, and when you do the high e string snaps
#she's visibly disappointed, but is still eager to keep playing

#while she's messing around you get up and see your phone on your desk

label:day2PhoneCall
#missed call from dad, who saw account activity from where you went shopping
#he won't give you your own card and has a card on his account so he gets a text msg when ever you spend money, and can see where

#choice -> call back?
#if call back trust++

#call goes really badly, and dad is abusive
#"how's school going"lie
#"I saw you bought some clothes... from a women's store... I didn't raise you to be like this" etc

#maybe they've put him down for liking femme stuff before, and are concerned about it. so it's more of a "i thought we talked about this"

#[do you only show one side of it or skip dialogue or whole dialogue]
label:day2DeepTalk
#after call you talk to alice who's been messing around on guitar
#she's already started figuring out nice sounding chords you don't think you've ever played 
# you're a little overwhelmed by how quick she's learning

#at first she's like excited to share with you (in autism mode)
#at first mc is like "oh that's cool" but in a detatched and apathetic way
#she senses that she doesn't have his approval, so she gets moody
#mc gets defensive: Why are you angry, i literally didn't do anything

#You start to lash out at her

#contrast of how the 2 of them argue

#Alice: short and cold and precise when she's argueing, but when she's really hurt, will also do insults she doesn't mean. More petty. Tends to run away, when like this.
#MC:bottles up, tries not to express, but if he panics, he word vomits, with internal stuff leaking out. Sometimes he deflects and blames others. Focuses on what-ifs, over thinker.

#choice as to whether to fully give into it or whether to take a step back
#[I think all of the decisions need to be subtle, not GOOD CHOICE or BAD CHOICE]
#She's on the verge of tears, and you take a step back


#Explain that your relationship with your parents isn't ideal, and that they aren't proud of who you are but only when you 
#match the image of you they already have

#mc is masking that he's not doing anything: he's close to failing courses, tests grades aren't good
#he's lying to his parents about it

#we can explore the impact and stress of needing to lie

#A huge part of why you're afraid to do stuff, make music, wear clothes, (be like your neighbour) is that you've always been given a hard time
#just want to love myself, but every step i make towards that is met with pain
#So i'm stuck between trying to pretend to be who they want, and trying to express who i am, and both of those aren't an option
#maybe that's why I'm stuck in this small room, feeling like my life is on hold
#but time keeps moving, i keep aging, i can't stay in uni for ever, and I'm going to die one day
#and that's scary

#alice listens to what you have to say (how does she respond?)
#beware of just telling and not showing (try to be more subtle maybe?)

#FOCUS:You can't live for conditional love: pretending to be something you're not, when you only live one.

label:day2Evening
#how do you spend the rest of the evening? Watch the dvds from neighbour?

#maybe mc msgs neighbour on discord to say about string, he tells you about his friend working at a music store

#<- maybe the order here needs to change ->
#defuse by doing something together, show her music on youtube?  maybe you show her a little bit before, and then something after?
#You make a promise that tomorrow you would go to a music store and buy a new set of strings
