#if you've got max trust then:
    #she has disappeared over night, and
    #she has written you a song and left a note on the bed
    #you listen to the song and start to cry
    #the lyrics are about accepting yourself etc
    #cuts to epilogue of you a few weeks later wearing clothing she pointed out for you
    #you press publish for your first ever youtube upload of a song you wrote: 
    #in the thumbnail we get to see, we see that the main character bought the guitar from the store
