#wake up
#she's been playing guitar the whole night on a guitar with old strings (missing a string). You feel sorry for her, but impressed at her drive.
#you decide to take her to a guitar store to buy new strings

#she's wowed by just how many types of guitars there are
#she find's a more pro-ish gutiar that she thinks really suits you (or that she really wants)
#you buy new strings and go back home

#you tune up the guitar strings for her and are suprised by just how good she sounds
#she explains as a mushroom she has connection with ancient wisdom, and so for her it was very intuitive, and she was able to learn super fast
#you end up becoming a little depressed and standoffish, but this time she asks you whats wrong
#you explain that you had always wanted to be creative but never had a spark, maybe waiting from a push from someone else
#jealous of how in a matter of hours, she got better than you were able to get (half-assedly), and so it makes you feel even more useless. 

#[how does she respond to the fact that today is her last day? How does she want to spend it with you?]
