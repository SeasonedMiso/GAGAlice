# In terms of the timing its too sudden and too much emotions... Doesn't feel earned

# Maybe this entire thing should be scraped as it's not really relevant to her character arc

# Butterfly Incident:
# The butterfly scene is a powerful moment that symbolizes Alice’s internal conflict and the pain she causes unintentionally. 
# It humanizes her and shows her vulnerability, making her more relatable and tragic.
# The main character’s reassurance that she’ll always have him and the squirrels creates a bond between them, 
# showing that he’s starting to see past her toxic exterior to the person she is inside.
 

#Also the contents need to change a lot

   # "You hear alice's taut vocal cords produce a strained sound as she exhales deeply"
   # "Not quite a voice, but still communicating to you a signal"
   # "Something's not right"
   # "She exhales again"
   # "This time the flow of breath carries with it a small whimper"
   # "You step closer towards her"
   # "And look more carefully at her hand"

   # ali "If we are so scary, why would you mix it into the milk you drink?"
