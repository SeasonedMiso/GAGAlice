    #cuts to epilogue of you a few weeks later wearing clothing she pointed out for you
    #you press publish for your first ever youtube upload of a song you wrote
    #in the thumbnail we get to see, we see that the main character bought the guitar from the store
    #maybe in the epilogue the main character is getting ready for his first live show with his band and it ends with him 
    #meeting up with the other band members, including the neighbour who he is now friends with
