Day2:
Redo when she finds out about competition

Day3:
---------
x Return back and she practice

x You eventually snap at her 

x Fight starts

She gets upset and walks out

You find her on roof

She opens up

They work on the song together

They go to the event together

She sings the song

Kellin comes up and talks to you 2 back stage

Go home and talk on the road back about her life and them

You cook her

It ends with you thinking about what you wanna do and then fades in on your desk with the guitar she wanted next to it, and a polaroid you her and kelling took on that night with her smiling, and other hints that mc took up kellins offer to play together (discord chat log being like "Yo, you coming to band practice today?")
