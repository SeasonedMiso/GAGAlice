label intro:

#comes out
#[with button route think of the silloutes and how much personality came through that... How would she be posed for that?]

#intial talk with Alice
#"will you submit to me?" 
#if yes bad end? maybe no choice at all the first time
#choice gives you either trust++ if you deal well, or neutral if not
#[from which point should the actual submission end branch off]
#from here we can begin to hint at her scent etc being mind-altering
#alice is taken aback by you not giving her attention, and runs off

#in this panic you decide to take a moment to cool off, let her calm down
# you decide to check website and see the website to understand whats going on
#you see that you have a discord notification, you reply to friend and tell himm your situation
#he's confused why you aren't taking this oppertunity

#you find her on the roof
#try to understand why she got mad
#open up a little towards her too
#go back to room together

#you suggest that you do something together?

#sleep
