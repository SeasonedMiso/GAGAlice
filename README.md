#notes
#the ending structure of bad ends etc needs to be reworked 
#In button route, choices and dialogue need to change when she ISN't the only option available
#in button route change naming function to one line capitalize script and check against bad cases
#why is sabrina using playername and player_name (really bad and confusing code practice)
#i think that variables need to be changed, because rn they are under the assumption that button route is only route.

#make sure the narration is consistnet with tense
