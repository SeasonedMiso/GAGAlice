#notes
#the ending structure of bad ends etc needs to be reworked 
#In button route, choices and dialogue need to change when she ISN't the only option available
#in button route change naming function to one line capitalize script and check against bad cases
#why is sabrina using playername and player_name (really bad and confusing code practice)
#i think that variables need to be changed, because rn they are under the assumption that button route is only route.

#make sure the narration is consistnet with tense
#adding a line to this for not reason

----
#make it that she is sold as suicide cure: consume day 1 for max potency, but losing potency everyday
#maybe in one of the neutral ends she prepares herself for you, chopping her arm on the chopping board when you wake up
#maybe every route ends with you needing to eat her, as a final cartharsis
#he studies biology, so make him more arrogant about his assumed knowledge of mushrooms
#soon to be college dropout
#internal monologue is present tense 2nd person

#Don't lose focus that the main arc is: MC helps mushroom girl to overcome her issue, and his issue gets solved as a result.
#The main ccharacters issues aren't the main focus, but are a byproduct
#make the girl more of a focus than the mc

#don't lose the focus of the mc as a self insert. You can develop stuff, but don't make the focus on "here's my life responding to this situation"
#make the focus the situation, and the mc's life stuff is flavour.
#focus on the experiences you have with her specifically.
#how you manuver the experieinces around her. 

#maybe the neighbour interaction, and guitar store friend don't serve the plot
#the interactions with Alice need to be stronger, so they don't feel like they are taking away.
#Focus more on the responsibility the mc feels, and how he feels bad for shattering her ego.
#day 2 date scene, you are both sampling things for her to see if she's passionate about them.

#mushrooms are made by tech bros, and are only installed with knowledge that is funny, novel and used (knowledge about sec, mushroom trivia)
