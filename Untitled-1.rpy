Rooftop reworked:
# he goes up to roof sweaty
# starts trying to apologise

m "Alice!"
m "I- *pant* I- "
m "I wanna say that I'm-"

# is interrupted by alice somberly talking at him about butterfly
ali "You know..."
ali "Since we went out yesterday..."
ali "I've been thinking a lot about butterflies..."
m "?"
"You look down at her sitting on the floor, and notice a large red butterfly on her fingertip"
ali "When we went to the cafe... At first I was really surprised when the waiter brought me that butterfly art"
ali "And I thought about what it might mean"
ali "Maybe I'm just overthinking it, and he just went of of vibes but..."
ali "Maybe there was a reason that he chose that."
ali "And so I thought really hard about it..."
ali "And after you went to sleep, I took a break from practicing to do a little research"
ali "You know... Butterflies aren't that different to me..."
ali "They're really pretty..."
ali "But it doesn't last that long..."
ali "After they come out of their cacoon, they only have X days to live..."
ali "To breed and be attractive enough to breed and to leave any sort of lasting legacy"
ali "To have any proof that they existed at all..."
ali "So I see myself in them"

ali "And they made me think a lot about myself..."
ali "My life..."

ali "I want my life to mean something... Anything..."
ali "To be remembered as a person that did something"
ali "And not just a pretty butterfly that's gone with the wind"

ali "But I'm still scared..."
ali "I'm scared that no matter what I do"
ali "Even if I could change the entire world"
ali "It wouldn't change that I feel like I do"

ali "So I wanna say I'm sorry"
ali "I'm sorry for losing sight of you, and for pushing you away"
ali "It's just hard you know..."
ali "The time we have is limited, and in the moment, it's easy to tell yourself that what you're focused on is the most important thing in the world"
ali "But I didn't want to push you away"
ali "I should have treasured the time I have with you more..."

ali "This butterfly over here..."
ali "It's dead..."
ali "Because of me..."
ali "I just wanted to touch it so when it flew over to me"
ali "I was really happy..."
ali "But I'm toxic..."
ali "You know the fly in fly aminita comes from the fact that they used to use us to kill flies by putting us in milk"
ali "It's like... Why do I have to be like this?"
ali "Why do I hurt those around me just by existing?"
ali "I just *sob* "
