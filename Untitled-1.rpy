Rooftop reworked:
# he goes up to roof sweaty
# starts trying to apologise

m "Alice!"
m "I- *pant* I- "
m "I wanna say that I'm-"

# is interrupted by alice somberly talking at him about butterfly
ali "You know..."
ali "Since we went out yesterday..."
ali "I've been thinking a lot about butterflies..."
m "?"
"You look down at her sitting on the floor, and notice a large red butterfly on her fingertip"
ali "When we went to the cafe... At first I was really surprised when the waiter brought me that butterfly art"
ali "And I thought about what it might mean"
ali "Maybe I'm just overthinking it, and he just went of of vibes but..."
ali "Maybe there was a reason that he chose that."
ali "And so I thought really hard about it..."
ali "And after you went to sleep, I took a break from practicing to do a little research"
ali "You know... Butterflies aren't that different to me..."
ali "They're really pretty..."
ali "But it doesn't last that long..."
ali "After they come out of their cacoon, they only have X days to live..."
ali "To breed and be attractive enough to breed and to leave any sort of lasting legacy"
ali "To have any proof that they existed at all..."
ali "So I see myself in them"

ali "And they made me think a lot about myself..."
ali "My life..."

ali "I want my life to mean something... Anything..."
ali "To be remembered as a person that did something"
ali "And not just a pretty butterfly that's gone with the wind"

ali "But I'm still scared..."
ali "I'm scared that no matter what I do"
ali "Even if I could change the entire world"
ali "It wouldn't change that I feel like I do"

ali "So I wanna say I'm sorry"
ali "I'm sorry for losing sight of you, and for pushing you away"
ali "It's just hard you know..."
ali "The time we have is limited, and in the moment, it's easy to tell yourself that what you're focused on is the most important thing in the world"
ali "But I didn't want to push you away"
ali "I should have treasured the time I have with you more..."

ali "This butterfly over here..."
ali "It's dead..."
ali "Because of me..."
ali "I just wanted to touch it so when it flew over to me"
ali "I was really happy..."
ali "But I'm toxic..."
ali "You know the fly in fly aminita comes from the fact that they used to use us to kill flies by putting us in milk"
ali "It's like... Why do I have to be like this?"
ali "Why do I hurt those around me just by existing?"
ali "I just *sob*"

m "You know..."
m "You've been playing guitar for a couple of hours..."
m "And you're already better at it than I've ever been at anything"
m "You're amazing, and I don't think you know how much you are..."
m "I was thinking about how I lashed out earlier and..."
m "I think... I'm jealous of you"
m "Of your talent"
m "Of your looks"
m "Of everything"
m "And I know maybe it's selfish for me to say that but"
m "I just wanted to spend a bit more time with you before you..."

# I think it's important that he says this at some point but the timing feels bad here
m "Damn I'm fucking pathetic..."
m "I have so much time compared to you, but I still haven't accomplished a thing."

m "I tell my self I'll learn to draw."
m "Or learn an instrument."
show mc shout
m "Or fucking anything."
show mc sad
m "I just want to like myself."
m "But even then..."
m "I know it will never be enough"
m "Even if I tried to like myself it wouldn't be enough for my parents"
show mc slightsad
m "Because all they want me to be is the person they THINK I am"
show mc vannoyed
m "But I CAN'T be that person!!"
m "I've never been that person..."

ali "..."
show mc normalside
m "They think I'm a straight A student, with lots of friends."
m "My dad is making up fantasies of me having a girlfriend and living up to how he was in college"
m "I don't even know what he would do if he found out"
show mc cynical
m "Who I {i}actually{/i} am"
show mc stressed
m "That I'm on the verge of flunking out"
m "That I have no friends"
m "That I'm not like him..."

# nuance of disgust
show mc sulk
m "I just feel like..."
m "Time keeps moving..."
m "And I'm still alone... Here... In my room."
m "But I can't stay in college for ever."
m "I'm going to drop out or scrape through."
m "And then I'm going to work doing some crappy deskjob I hate, until I get old..."
m "And then I die."

m "I'm sorry, I came to apologize and I just ended up talking at you..."
