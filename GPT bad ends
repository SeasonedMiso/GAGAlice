Come up with more but keep in mind that the endings for the most part don't need to go as far in the main plot tree as the performance. She may not even perform, or even discover music. Make some of them incredibly dark and unsettling, perhaps dealing with some of the themes and topics brought up that haven't been explored so far, such as sex, trauma, or the nature of the company that sold her.

あなた:
Keep in mind with all of these endings that Alice will die at the end of day 3 regardless of what happens, so it doesn't make sense that she travels the world. Also she isn't a machine so her programming is biological. She cannot be reset like a robot.
