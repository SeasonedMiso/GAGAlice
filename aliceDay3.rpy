# Day 3: 
# Alice has been working extremely hard and obsessively on her song for the entire night.

# MC goes out to get a new set of strings for her, but on the way back gets a call from his father. His father is a narcissist. 
   
   #Wake up to alice with bloodshot eyes, shes been grinding all night
   #You call out to her but she ignores you at first
   #You pull off her headphones off her
   #She says gm but needs to keep grinding
   #choice: Insist she takes a break to come with



#[here i think the bg music when she's practicing should be the song she's writing, but at various levels of playing: think wa2]

label day3Morning:
"You wake up to the rhythm of dull strumming."
m "Damn you're still going?"
ali "..."
m "Hello? Good morning~"
ali "..."
"She seems to be completely ingulfed in the guitar world."
"She can't hear you."
"You slowly get out of bed and walk towards the kettle to make some coffee."
"While the kettle boils you look over to her and watch her play."
"You can't hear her that well over the rumbling of water being heated."
"Her movements look a lot more confident that you remember last night"
"But when you look at her face you see her eyes are bloodshot."
"You walk over to her and tap her shoulder gently."
m "..."
"No response"
"You bring your hand up to the top of her head and begin to lift the headphones upwards."
ali "EEK! Wha-"
m "Good morning!"
ali "Jeez, don't scare me like that"
m "Haha, sorry about that."
m "Looks like you've been going the whole night?"
ali "Yeah but I'm behind on time."
ali "There's no way I'm going to win at this rate."
#Maybe it would be funny if she forgets she hasn't practiced singing, so and the concert she doesn't realize and that's what her big failure is
m "Take it easy, you still have lots of time."
m "And besides, it's not about the outcome, it's about the experience."
ali "Yeah, right, sure."
"She turns back to the paper she's been taking notes on and resumes her practice."
"You look at the notes, but it looks like no music notation you've ever seen before."
m "Hey, how did you learn how to read music?"
ali "What do you mean?"
m "Like your notes, they must be some kind of thing you learned right?"
ali "Nah, I just drew stuff to help me remember what part of the song go where."
"You look closer at the page and it's full of abstract interconnecting shapes."
m "Uhh, I have no idea what i'm looking at."
ali "That's okay, just as long as I know."
"You hear the kettle click and walk over to it."
"You can't help but be impressed by her"
"But you also feel a bit..."
"..."
#Maybe leave this just as an incomplete sentence

m "Okay I'm alive now"
ali "*strum* *strum*"
m "Are you ready to go to the guitar store?"
ali '*pickedy* *pick*'
"She can't hear you again"
"You walk over to her and slowly wave your hand in front of her vision"
ali "Whaaat~"
m "Do you wanna go get strings or not?"
ali "Ughhh, do I have to?"
m "If you can do with out them then I guess not."
ali "..."
ali "Can't you just go for me? I'm running out of time and I still have so much to do"
m "I think you should take a break, you've been grinding for like 12 hours straight"
ali "Nooooo~"
ali "I don't have time to go!"
m ("Damn what should I do?")
choice:let her keep grinding, 
   -Take her along with you
m "Hey, I'm kind of worried about you"
m "You've been grinding non-stop for the entire night"
m "Please, come with me"
ali "Ugh, fine~"

#What do they talk about on the way?
#For now they're just going to walk in silence
"The two of you walk together towards the music store."
"You walk a little ahead of her, and she follows your back"
"You get worried that she's lost sight of you, or got lost somewhere along the way"
"So you check over your shoulder every few minutes, but she's always right behind you"
"Walking lazily, yet somewhat annoyed."

#   For "The snapping point", I think his self-doubt about how quickly she's improved at guitar could be better portrayed:
#   instead of saying it all from the POV of why this is hard for him (which is too obviously self-focused + annoys me), 
#   he can phrase it as a frustrated encouragment, trying to get her to see why everything is okay and she can stop stressing and be proud of all she has done instead.
#   For example, "Why are you so upset/stressed/afraid? Stop putting yourself down - don't you know how much I look up to you? You've worked so hard, you've learned so much,
#   and what I can sounds better than anything I could do. You've accomplished more than I ever have!" 
#   This way MC's self-hate is more backhanded AND it shows how their relationship has grown to the point that
#   he is genuinely worried about her and wants her to see how HE sees her.

# Ideally they make up and both end up with a healthier outlook as a result of the fight. 
# He realizes that he's just making excuses and that he's just jealous that she's doing what he's always want to, and she realizes that it's okay to not be perfect, 
# and just to let what happens happen. She plays at the event but makes a couple mistakes, and ends up not winning, 
# In fact, maybe she even drops her pick, or embaressing herself and needing to start over or something. But she goes throurgh it with a smile, 
# because she just wants to know that she did something meaningful. 

# Maybe the lyrics of the song reflect how she feels about the main character which adds more catharsis to the fight that they had earlier, 
# where although she looked like she cared more about the song than spending time with him in her last day, 
# it's because she wanted to properly communicate how she felt towards him. The main character and her go home, for him to slit her throat, 
# and properly prepare her to eat without toxins, knowing that she has no regrets, and that the MC now has a new outlook on life,
# and is going to try to become the version of himself he wants to be, free from what anyone else thinks of him


# Alice’s reaction could reveal her own fears of inadequacy, despite her apparent confidence. 
# The reconciliation should feel earned, with both characters acknowledging their mistakes and growing from the experience. 
# This could be a moment where they find common ground in their struggles, leading to mutual understanding and support.




# 3. Revealing Deep Fears:
#   Alice’s Fear: 
#     During the fight, Alice could reveal that she’s terrified of dying without having done anything meaningful. 
#     She might admit that the reason she’s pushing so hard is that she’s scared of being forgotten, of being just another product.
    
#   MC’s Confession:
#     In turn, the main character could confess that he’s scared of never amounting to anything, of being a disappointment to his parents and to himself.
#     He might admit that he envies Alice because she’s living the kind of bold, fearless life he’s always wanted, even if it’s only for a few days.
    
#   Resolution: 
#     This mutual confession could lead to a moment of understanding where they both realize they’re projecting their fears onto each other. 
#     The fight could end with them both calming down, realizing that they’re not so different after all.

#     The main character, driven by the fear of losing Alice, could lash out, telling her that she’s wasting the little time they have left on 
#     something that won’t change anything. He might confess that he’s terrified of her dying without them really connecting.


#   A Quiet Apology: After the fight, they might sit in silence, both emotionally drained, before one of them quietly apologizes. 
# This could lead to a tender moment where they both acknowledge their fears and insecurities.

   #He helps her refine the song with what ever feedback he can give
   #They go to the event
   #Kellin is there and is afraid to see alice at first, but eventually he chills out around her
   #Her time comes to play 
   #She goes up and (trips, or drops pick, or mic howls really bad, or guitar jack cuts out)
   #She smiles and make a joke of it into the mic, and the audience laughs with her
   #The lyrics are using butterfly metaphor and about how she feels about life, and the mc
   #She doesn't win the competion
   # Kellin comes up to her and he shows her respect and asks her about the song
   Post-concert, for some bittersweetness and dramatic irony, Kellin could go over the top about how well Alice did, and how much potential she has if she keeps on going + he wants to make future plans with her and begs her to join his band. Alice and MC know she can't, but how they navigate that convo could be interesting, and can help lead to the somber tone of the "one last conversation" on the way home. 
   # You and her go home together and have one last conversation on the way home
   # She tells you there might be a way to cook her without dying
   # It ends with you thinking about what you want to do with your life, about how maybe you'll go and get that guitar, or take kellin up on playing in a band with him
   # But no matter what happens, you're going to start from trying to like yourself first

Alice’s Performance:
Alice’s performance is a culmination of her journey. The mistakes she makes, and how she handles them, symbolize her acceptance of imperfection and her growth as a character.
The song’s lyrics could be a powerful way for Alice to express her feelings towards the main character, showing that her focus on the song was,
in fact, a way to connect with him on a deeper level.
Her decision to smile through the performance, despite the errors, underscores the theme of finding meaning in the process rather than the outcome. 
This could resonate with the main character, helping him see the value in his own efforts, regardless of external validation.

Final Scene:
The final scene, where the main character prepares Alice for consumption, is both poignant and symbolic. It’s a moment of acceptance and closure,
as both characters come to terms with their respective journeys.
The act of consuming Alice could be seen as the main character internalizing the lessons she’s taught him, 
carrying her memory and the meaning of their time together forward in his life.
This ending reinforces the themes of mortality, self-acceptance, and breaking free from societal expectations. 
The main character’s newfound resolve to live authentically could be a bittersweet yet hopeful conclusion to the route.
