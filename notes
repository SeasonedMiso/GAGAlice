one character plays into light novel tropes but the other is not from the same genre. 
tsundere thins when alice allows mc to spray her (Day 3). 

Day 1:

after gets out box, first cg of her leaning forward hand on chin kuudere like Senjogahara expression. He freaks out and pushes her away.
“fine whatever guess i’ll go screw some other guy”
mc uses discord
then goes to look
not sure where to look = anxious. hypes self up to go outside and search
hears a girlish squeal
runs to bathroom
he thinks it’s alice’s screaming, but once inside she’s like wtf it was him not me - points to neighbour showering.
neighbour is a eldritch blob (on the friendlier/shocked side with dyed hair). in funny jojo pose covering parts and very scared.
brief argument where alice chastises mc on being too scared to do her.



So fundamentally this is a story about extrinsic validation and the toxicity of it
but i don't feel like i'm adaquetly addressing a lot of the points
so for example
alice is supposed to be born as someone who is programmed to have internalized socialtal standards about women
than being pretty and having men attracted to you (not for what you are able to accomplish) but because of the image of who you are
is fundamentally toxic to not only those around you but to yourself as well
and i don't feel like i've caputered that
So maybe something to do with like
when mc doesn't love her she gets really bad dysmorphia or like
tries to modify her face with a knife
in a bad end or something
could be a cool way of dealing with those themes
i think maybe it's better that i wall of text
and wait until i'm done before hearing your takes
as i want to try to clearly get what i was thinking about out
(still want to hear afterwards tho)
I think the main character dealing with toxic masculinity from his discord friend and dad is good
but it feels a little unnatural and not super cohessive rn
so maybe we can just brain storm some more about that
especially to do with his realtionship to alice
that maybe at first she should be more like
"if you were a real man..."
sort of stuff
at least at first in day 1
also i think there should be a bit more conflict in terms of like maybe
them brushing off this gendered society thing to each other
like "you have it so much easier"
i think like
a fundamental women experience is that there's an assumed like
standard of beauty and those below it are hardly considered like
people
but if you are concerned at all with being over that line, and being into beauty or whatever
then you're seen as vain
Miso — Today at 12:10 AM
that double standard feels very important here
like the contrast between a society that punishes you for not complying, but berates your attempts to comply
So I want to fit that in some how
ummmm
yeah that's it
i also feel like maybe the day3 ending should also focus on the concequences of this like
expectation of greatness
the option paralysis of like
"i can be anything, but here i am in my room getting nowhere fast"
the dread of not having your ideal life
And that the route should be about overcoming and coming to peace with a healthier mindset of
doing stuff because the act itself is rewarding
and that sharing it with people can also be incredibly wholesome
etc
okay now im really done hopefully maybe
