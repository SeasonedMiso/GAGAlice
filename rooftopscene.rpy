    go up to roof 
look down on the university
you end up reminicing about university and how you feel like you aren't taking advantage of where you live
 she gets bored
 then it goes dark and the stars come out
 she doesn't know what they are
 you explain how people look up and see constalations and assign meaning to the unknown
 she's all like "hmmmm"
 
 m "I guess I do have somewhere I like to go"
 ali "Huh, I thought you didn't leave your cave"
 m "Even I need a change of scenery sometimes!"
 "The two of you walk through the door, and you lead the way up through the hallway and up the stairs"
 play sound open door
 show rooftop
 m "Isn't it nice up here?"
 ali "... Seriously?"
 ali "The rooftop?"
 m "Yeah I come here when I need a place to think and be by myself"
 m "Look! See how crazy the campus looks from above!"
 m "It's really pretty..."
 m "It kinda makes me feel bad..."
 m "My parents are sacrificing so much to send me to such a beatiful place..."
 m "And I'm wasting it all in my room alone..."
 ali "And this is supposed to make me feel better how exactly?"
 m "I- uh..."
 show mc sad
 m "..."
 show transition to evening
 ali "Huh? Why is it getting dark all of a sudden"
 m "Yeah we picked a good time to come out! It's sunset."
 ali "Sunset..."
 m "Hey look over there! You can see the evening star"
 ali "I don't see anything"
 m "Look closer, it's like a little spec of red light"
 ali "I don't-"
 ali "Oh I think I see it"
 m "It's a planet actually. A ball of rock, just like earth!"
 ali "You mean there's more places just like this? What kind of people live there?"
 m "None that we know of... Yet at least haha"
 ali "..."
 m "Look you can see more coming out!"
 transition to night
 m "See it's like a sea of stars"
 m "There's not much light polution compared to other cities, so you can see it okay"
 m "But where my parents live it's like 5 times brighter than this."
 ali "There's so many..."
 m "Right? Most of them are actually burning balls of gas, like our sun... Some of them are so far away that the light takes billions of years to reach us."
 ali "Billions... Is that a lot?"
 m "Say that you live 3 days... That means an avarage human lives like 10 thousand times longer than you."
 m "And a human life span is 10 million times shorter than how long it takes that light..."
 ali "Uhhhh"
 m "Yeah, I don't really understand the big numbers either..."
 m "But anyways, the universe is a big place... Bigger than any of us can ever know..."
 ali "..."
 m "You see that one there?"
 m "There's like 3 bright ones in a row over there..." 
 m "They're called Orion's Belt..."
